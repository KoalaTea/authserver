# THE JANK
This records the jank that exists in the project.

## Dependencies
there exists old dependencies which are from a time when some libraries had specific requirements and that lead to some installing order shenanigans. For now I am keeping it until I get a change to actually dig through and fix it all. in main.go 1.17 is the right version for the server otel then.
But the current version seems to at least partially work.
